CGI Calculator
==============

Function
========

Implements a simple, web-based calculator.


Usage
=====

Place the exectuable in the cgi-bin (or equivalent) directory
on your web server. Call it without any input to generate the
initial HTML interface. DO NOT PUT THIS PROGRAM UNEDITED ON A
PRODUCTION WEB SERVER!! It has been written for demonstration
and illustrative purposes, and may be missing important security
checks and safeguards!


Installation
============

If your system supports 'make', simply type:

    make

at the command line to build the project. Otherwise, you will have
to compile and link 'calc.c' and 'cgihelp.c' in your usual way. 
'calc.c' uses functions from the math library, so don't forget to link
this in if you compile it yourself.
