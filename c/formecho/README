Function
========

Simple CGI script to echo the contents of an HTML form.


Installation
============

If you system supports "make", simply type:

    make

at the command line to build the project. Otherwise, you will need
to compile and link formecho.c and cgihelp.c in the normal way.

The resultant executable should be placed in the folder where CGI
scripts are normally kept on your server. DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM
UNMODIFIED ON A PRODUCTION WEB SERVER!!! It has been written for
demonstration purposes, and is missing a number of key security
features.
