PERM

Calculates all possible permutations of a set of 'n' items.

This program uses a recursive algorithm. Two versions are supplied, one
where the data and stack are represented using arrays, and another where
they are represented using linked lists.


USAGE
=====

Type:

    ./perm 4

where the single argument is the number of items in the set (must be
between 1 and 26 inclusive).


COMPILATION
===========

Type one of the following:

    make
    make array
    make list

to build the appropriate version (array is the default). Both targets make
an executable called "perm".

You may need to edit/rename the makefile according to your environment's
requirements.
